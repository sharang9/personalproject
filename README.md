PROJECT HEADLINES

  Our group project for the semester was creating an IOS/Android app for our clients Feelfree. Initially I was reluctant in learning about Xcode, but as I researched online, I found a number of useful websites that taught IOS application development. One such website was Udemy.com. Udemy.com is an online platform for learning online courses. The website had a course called "Learn IOS 8 Development". I purchased the course and I started practising basic code. I decided to follow the video lessons and practise code line by line. So for my personal project I decided to create a new application that can I post camera pictures on phone to instagram. I am still working on my application, as it is not yet complete. But I have posted the code that I have working on so far. 
  
  It was helpful to practise the code as I implemented similar code in our project as well. For my personal project, I have downloaded a basic project from the course documents for my IOS course. The project already has all the frameworks installed. I decided to create an application that captures images from the phone and displays them on Instagram/Facebook. 
  
  I downloaded the blank project and started building on the app. I created a number of storyboards displaying what each screen will look like. I have attached the screenshots of the app in a seperate folder called screenshots. 
  
WHAT HAVE I LEARNED?

I have learned so much in the past 3 months. During the start of the semester, I didn't even what Xcode was. But now, I am comfortable with the software and I would like to learn more about it. 

Here are some of the interesting things I have learned so far:

- Creating a login/signup button
- Storing login/sign up information into Parse database
- Ability to create a cloud database on Parse.com and linking it with the application
- Creating objects and retrieving objects from the database
- Ability to login into the app with a facebook login

The app currently is not on the app store as it is being worked on. 

This project is my first project and I have learnt a lot so far. Everyday I learn something new and I like the flexibility of playing with code...... Test
